Cuckoo
=======

A simple GTK3 Alarm application.

**Warning! This application is currently non-functioning.**

This project is the revitalization of an old app that I created back in 2012
as a part of the first Ubuntu App Showdown. This is my attempt to rebuild
Cuckoo with modern standards and more compatible with other Linux
distributions.
